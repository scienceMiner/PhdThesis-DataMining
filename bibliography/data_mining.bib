  abstract =     "Around the world there are innumerable databases of
                 information. The quantity of information available has
                 created a high demand for automatic methods for
                 searching these databases and extracting specific kinds
                 of information. Unfortunately, the information in these
                 databases increasingly contains signals that have no
                 corresponding classification symbols. Examples include
                 databases of images, sounds, etc. A few systems have
                 been written to help solve these search and retrieve
                 issues. But we can not write a new system for every
                 kind of signal we want to recognize and extract. Some
                 work has been done on automating (i.e. learning) the
                 task of identifying desired signal elements. It would
                 be useful to automate (learn) not just a part of the
                 classification function, but the entire signal
                 identification program. It would be helpful if we could
                 use the same learning architecture to automatically
                 create these programs for distinguishing many different
                 classes of the same signal type. It would be better
                 still if we could use the same learning architecture to
                 create these programs even for signal types as
                 different as images and sound waves. We introduce PADO
                 (Parallel Architecture Discovery and Orchestration), a
                 learning architecture designed to deliver this. PADO
                 has at its core a variant of genetic programming (GP)
                 that extends the paradigm to explore the space of
                 algorithms. PADO learns the entire classification
                 algorithm for an arbitrary signal type with arbitrary
                 signal class distinctions. This architecture has been
                 designed specifically for signal understanding and
                 classification. The architecture of PADO and its
                 achievements on the recovery of visual and acoustic
                 signal classes from test databases are the subjects of
                 this article.",

  abstract =     "The field of knowledge discovery in databases, or
                 {"}<strong>Data Mining</strong>{"}, has received increasing attention
                 during recent years as large organizations have begun
                 to realize the potential value of the information that
                 is stored implicitly in their databases. One specific
                 <strong>data mining</strong> task is the mining of Association Rules,
                 particularly from retail data. The task is to determine
                 patterns (or rules) that characterize the shopping
                 behavior of customers from a large database of previous
                 consumer transactions. The rules can then be used to
                 focus marketing efforts such as product placement and
                 sales promotions.\par Because early algorithms required
                 an unpredictably large number of IO operations,
                 reducing IO cost has been the primary target of the
                 algorithms presented in the literature. One of the most
                 recent proposed algorithms, called PARTITION, uses a
                 new TID-list data representation and a new partitioning
                 technique. The partitioning technique reduces IO cost
                 to a constant amount by processing one database portion
                 at a time in memory. We implemented an algorithm called
                 SPTID that incorporates both TID-lists and partitioning
                 to study their benefits. For comparison, a
                 non-partitioning algorithm called SEAR, which is based
                 on a new prefix-tree data structure, is used. Our
                 experiments with SPTID and SEAR indicate that TID-lists
                 have inherent inefficiencies; furthermore, because all
                 of the algorithms tested tend to be CPU-bound trading
                 CPU-overhead against I/O operations by partitioning did
                 not lead to better performance.\par In order to scale
                 mining algorithms to the huge databases (e.g., multiple
                 Terabytes) that large organizations will manage in the
                 near future, we implemented parallel versions of SEAR
                 and SPEAR (its partitioned counterpart). The
                 performance results show that, while both algorithms
                 parallelize easily and obtain good speedup and scale-up
                 results, the parallel SEAR version performs better than
                 parallel SPEAR, despite the fact that it uses more
                 communication.",

                 global information network (Internet), efficient and
                 effective discovery of resource and knowledge from the
                 ``global information base'' has become an imminent
                 research issue, especially with the advent of the
                 Information Highway. In this article, a multiple
                 layered database (MLDB) approach is proposed to handle
                 the resource and knowledge discovery in global
                 information base. A multiple layered database is a
                 database formed by generalization and transformation of
                 the information, layer-by-layer, starting from the
                 original information base (treated as layer-0, the
                 primitive layer). Information retrieval, <strong>data mining</strong>,
                 and data analysis techniques can be used to extract and
                 transform information from a lower layer database to a
                 higher one. Layer-1 and higher layers of an MLDB can be
                 modeled by an extended-relational or object-oriented
                 model, constructed automatically, and updated
                 incrementally. Information at all the layers except the
