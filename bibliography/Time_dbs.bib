                 widely held throughout the research of temporally
                 oriented data models (TODM) is that the associated
                 schema never changes. The implications of allowing data
                 structures to evolve over time within a TODM and
                 related databases are examined in this paper, and key
                 issues and concepts are identified. Specifically,
                 temporally oriented data definition (TODD) raises
                 questions with respect to (1) the evolution of meanings
                 in databases, (2) the nature of the temporal prevalence
                 of database schema, and (3) the general principles that
                 may guide the implementation of a TODM database with
                 TODD."
