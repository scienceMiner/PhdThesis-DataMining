A telecommunication network produces daily large amounts of alarm data.
The data contains hidden valuable knowledge about the behavior of the 
network. This knowledge can be used in filtering redundant alarms, 
locating problems in the network, and possibly in predicting severe 
faults. We describe the TASA (Telecommunication Network Alarm Sequence 
Analyzer) system for discovering and browsing knowledge from large alarm 
databases. 

The system is built on the basis of viewing knowledge discovery as an
interactive and iterative process, containing data collection, pattern
discovery, rule postprocessing, etc. The system uses a novel framework 
for locating frequently occurring episodes from sequential data.

The TASA system offers a variety of selection and ordering criteria
for episodes, and supports iterative retrieval from the discovered 
knowledge. This means that a large part of the iterative nature of the 
KDD process can be replaced by iteration in the rule postprocessing 
stage. The user interface is based on dynamically generated HTML.
The system is in experimental use, and the results are encouraging:
some of the discovered knowledge is being integrated into the alarm
handling software of telecommunication operators.},

Sequences of events describing the behavior and actions of 
users or systems can be collected in several domains.
In this paper we consider the problem of recognizing 
frequent episodes in such sequences of events.
An episode is defined to be a collection of
events that occur within time intervals of a given size 
in a given partial order.
Once such episodes are known, one can produce rules for
describing or predicting the behavior of the sequence.
We describe an efficient algorithm for the 
discovery of all frequent episodes from 
a given class of episodes,
and present experimental results.}

Association rules are statements of the form ``for 90 \% 
of the rows of the relation, if the row has value 1 in 
the columns in set $W$,  then it has 1 also in column $B$''.
Agrawal, Imielinski, and Swami introduced the  problem
of mining association rules from large collections of data, 
and gave a method based on successive passes over the database.
We give an improved algorithm for the problem.
The method is based on careful combinatorial analysis 
of the information obtained in previous passes;
this makes it possible to eliminate unnecessary candidate rules.
Experiments on a university course enrollment database indicate
that the method outperforms the previous one by a factor of 5.
We also show that sampling is in general a very efficient way of 
finding such rules.}
