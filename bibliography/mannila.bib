abstract  ="Structured texts (for example dictionaries and user manuals)
           typically have a hierarchical (tree-like) structure. We describe
           a query language for retrieving information from collections of
           hierarchical text. The language is based on a tree pattern
           matching notion called tree inclusion. Tree inclusion allows easy
           expression of queries that use the structure and the content of
           the document. In using it a user need not be aware of the whole
           structure of the database. Thus a language based on tree
           inclusion is data independent, a property made necessary because
           of the great variance in the structure of the texts.",

           structured documents. The structure of the text is described
           using a context-free grammar, and the operations are implemented
           using a powerful query language. The system supports the use of
           user-defined multiple views of the documents: one view can
           contain all the structure explicitly, while another can contain
           only part of the document and have only part of the structure
           visible. This makes the system flexible for different editing

abstract    ="In recent years, research in relational design theory and in
             query optimization has established a firm ground for designing
             well-structured logical and physical database schemes. However,
             the design process prequires mastering a considerable amount of
             theoretical results. Furthermore, even for the initiated
             database designer, many of the known algorithms for logical
             design do not provide constructive guidelines for generating a
             database scheme that would prevent update anomalies and data
             inconsistencies. Nor do the algorithms and evaluation methods
             for file structures and query processing provide constructive
             physical design rules. We propose an expert tool that would
             make knowledge in relational design theory and query
             optimization automatically and transparently available to the
             database designer. This tool is a system with an interactive,
             graphical interface that uses examples to guide the designer
             through several phases of logical and physical database design.
             Logical design is based on example relations, and physical
             design on example queries. The example relations are
             automatically generated by the system. They contain sample data
             and satisfy the data dependencies that the designer specifies
             with the assistance of the expert tool. The example queries and
             their expected frequency are specified by the designer, using
             graphically displayed skeleton queries. The system generates a
             physical design scheme that optimizes the mix of queries
             expected by the designer, and computes a performance forecast.
             Both example relations and example queries can be modified by
             the designer, until the expert tool generates a satisfactory
             design.",

           rules from large collections of data. The number of discovered rules can, however, be so large that browsing the rule set and finding
           interesting rules from it can be quite difficult for the user. We show how a simple formalism of {\em rule templates} makes it possible
           to easily describe the structure of interesting rules. We also give examples of visualization of rules, and show how a visualization
           tool interfaces with rule templates.",

abstract  ="Association rules are statements of the form ``for 90 \% of the rows of the relation, if the row has value 1 in the
           columns in set $W$, then it has 1 also in column $B$''. Agrawal, Imielinski, and Swami introduced the problem of
           mining association rules from large collections of data, and gave a method based on successive passes over the
           database. We give an improved algorithm for the problem. The method is based on careful combinatorial analysis of
           the information obtained in previous passes; this makes it possible to eliminate unnecessary candidate rules.
           Experiments on a university course enrollment database indicate that the method outperforms the previous one by a
           factor of 5. We also show that sampling is in general a very efficient way of finding such rules.",
