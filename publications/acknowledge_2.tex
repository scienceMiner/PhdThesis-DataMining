I would like to thank my supervisor, Mark Levene, not only for his
continual support, advice, and encouragement, throughout the term of
my research but also for the numerous stimulating discussions we have had
on databses, data mining and many other research issues.  Similarly, I would
like to thank Nadav Zin, Jose Borges and Wilfred Ng.

I would like to thank the various anonymous reviewers who have
unknowingly improved the content of this thesis.

Finally, I would like to thank my parents,
George and Liz Collopy, to whom I dedicate this thesis, and without
whose love and encouragement I would surely not now be in the position
of writing these thesis acknowledgments. I would like to thank Deborah
for her love.
