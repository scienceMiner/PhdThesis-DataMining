Some of the work in this thesis has been previously published. 
The section on the evolution of relations in Chapter~\ref{chap:numdep}
was published in an
extended form as a technical report \cite{cl96} and in synopsised
form at IADT '98 \cite{cl98c}.

\medskip

The work on the use of resampling numerical dependency sets and the
use of a hill-climbing algorithm presented in
Chapter~\ref{chap:consistency} appears in two
publications. \cite{cl98b} focuses on the use of NDs and Resampling
whilst \cite{cl98} presents a more detailed overview of the complete
work with regard to the application of indefinite information in
relations as applied to the consistency problem.

\medskip

The work on the use of sequences and our specially developed temporal
logic presented in Chapters~\ref{chap:templog} and associated results detailed in Chapter~\ref{chap:tempresult}
appears in a technical report \cite{cl98f}, submitted for
publication.
